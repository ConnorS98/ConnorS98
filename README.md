#### Little About Me
Hey, I'm Connor! I love to program and create new things. I've recently discovered a passion for iOS development and am excited to keep working with Swift and see where it takes me. When I'm not sitting around my apartment I enjoy rock climbing and going for walks to get some fresh air and look for inspiration for new ideas and projects.

- 💼 I graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire with a B.S. in Computer Science - Software Engineering
